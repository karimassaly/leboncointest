This file is meant to explain multiples points about the coding process.

I have coded everything up to the bonus level. It is for this purpose that i needed to use a persistent storage such as the database Postgresql. Everything statistics oriented is directly stored inside this database.

First and foremost to be able to run our program we will need our persistent storage. To create the docker database container
our Makefile has the make store command.

Run : 

$make store

Now that we have our persistent storage up and running, we can launch our API that contains our endpoints.

Run : 

$make run

Our software uses multiple external packages such as : 

- Gorm https://gorm.io/
- Gin Gonic https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin

Gorm helps us communicate with our database and provide information directly to our software.
Gin Gonic helps building the router.
